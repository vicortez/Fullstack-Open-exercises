# Part 6: Anecdotes redux

This project was initially seeded with the code at [https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/redux-anecdotes](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/redux-anecdotes).

Its supposed to be an alternative version of the original app we made in part 1, but using Redux for state management.

This time we are using react-redux instead of directly using redux.
