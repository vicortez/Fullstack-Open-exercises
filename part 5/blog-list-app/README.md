This app was created as a solution to exercises in the part 5 of the fullstackopen course.

Its a blogpost listing app where we explore software testing and user authentication and authorization.
The backend started as a copy of the solution to part 4. The frontend was started with the git clone command: `git clone https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/bloglist-frontend`.
